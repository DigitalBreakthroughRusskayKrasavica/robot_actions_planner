# Submission
Using artificial intelligence models, we have created a solution through which the user can say what he wants from the robot, and the robot will automatically understand the request and determine the sequence of its actions, taking into account the current state of the environment thanks to a video camera.

## Used Technologies
Python, Juypyter Notebook, NLTK, TFIDF, Pytorch, Grounding DINO

## Main feature
Our model is simple and lightweight because it consists of two independent parts - a part for language processing and a part for photo processing - we applied the principle of "divide and conquer" instead of creating one huge model, and thanks to a unique solution, our model does not require training on the provided dataset
